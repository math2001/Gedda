> Markdown viewer

A simple app to just view a markdown file (in it's formatted form of course).

## Why?

Because I use vim, in my terminal. And i don't have any other text editor on my
system (except for mousepad). And I didn't want to install one just to be able
to quickly view a markdown file from a file explorer.
